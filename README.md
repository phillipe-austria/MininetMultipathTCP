There are 3 files of concern.  
mptcp.py is the main program that runs iperf and generates the JSON of iperf.  
graph_results.py ingests the json and spits out pretty graphs from the JSON  
CONSTANTS.py contains the constants required for the test. Change values in the array to change the test parameters
